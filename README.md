## Description
This GitHub repository contains a group project carried out during our Data Analysis course with World Code School. This project was developed by Luana, Patrick, Teddy, and me, focusing on the creation of a machine-learning-based program to suggest films based on user data by comparing the similarity of various measures with films in the given database. A user-friendly front-end application has also been developed.


## Project Stages
The project involved several stages:

* **Data Analysis**: Data exploration, identifying trends, and film characteristics.
* **Data Cleaning and Integration**: Performing joins between datasets, cleaning data, and searching for correlations.
* **Recommendation System**: Using machine learning algorithms to recommend films based on the viewer's preferences.
* **Interface**: Development of a front-end application and a dashboard with KPI analysis.


## Sources
The data used for this project were collected on [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) and [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/). The [documentation](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/) for the datasets is also available.


## Deliverables
* [Streamlit dashboard](https://dashboard-cinecreuse.streamlit.app/)
* [Demo Repository](https://github.com/karolinajedrzejewskaa/Movie-recommendation-system-demo.git) to watch the video showcasing the application's functionality.
  

This repository contains a variety of resources related to the project, including:

* A PDF presentation on the project subject.
* Various Jupyter notebooks featuring data visualizations, dataset merging, and cleaning processes.
* Front-end and back-end application code.
* Additional project-related files and resources.

**Note:** The application is not yet deployed. However, you can view a demo of the application in action in a video available in a separate repository.

## Technologies

* **Languages**: Python, JavaScript.
* **Python libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly scitkit-learn, Streamlit.
* **Tools**: VS Code, Streamlit, Flask, React, Github, Discord
